## Code contribution
To develop the documentation platform set up a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) development environment on your computer. Take a look at the [official docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) of Jekyll.

To run the Jekyll code locally use the command
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
The command sets up a local testing server. The web page is available afterwards on the localhost on port 4000.
